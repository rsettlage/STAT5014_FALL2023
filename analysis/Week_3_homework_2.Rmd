Homework 1 was all about being prepared.  Homework 2 is all about you.  Choose one of the website builders shown in class and simply get one up and running on GitHub.

As a reminder, some packages that assist this are:

+ blogdown  
+ distillr  
+ workflowr  
+ portfoliodown  
+ quarto  

NOTE: so far, all of the issues I have seen with Quarto are the student forgot to repeat step 8, re-render site and then get up to GitHub.

Also, I showed how to do it for a blog, you should choose what you want.  This is for you and it is up to you if you use it later to showcase you.
